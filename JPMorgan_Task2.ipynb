    "# undertaking the trades on given dates. Play around with the parameters and you'll be able to see this. \n",
    "# In the end the intent for this function returns the value of the contract.\n",
    "#The function takes in eight inputs:\n",
    "#- `in_dates`: A list of dates on which the gas is being injected into the storage facility.\n",
    "#- `in_prices`: A list of prices of gas on each of the injection dates.\n",
    "#- `out_dates`: A list of dates on which the gas is being withdrawn from the storage facility.\n",
    "#- `out_prices`: A list of prices of gas on each of the withdrawal dates.\n",
    "#- `rate`: The rate of gas in cubic feet per day.\n",
    "#- `storage_cost_rate`: A fixed monthly fee to store the gas\n",
    "#- `total_vol`: The total volume of gas in cubic feet that can be stored.\n",
    "#- `injection_withdrawal_cost_rate`: The injection/withdrawal cost of gas in dollars per cubic foot.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The function first ensures that all the dates are in sequence and sorted in ascending order. Then, it iterates\n",

    "#injects gas into the storage facility and calculates the cost to store the gas, the cost to purchase the gas,\n",
    "#and the injection cost. If the current date is a withdrawal date, it withdraws gas from the storage facility and\n",
    "#calculates the cash inflow from selling the gas, the cost to store the remaining gas, and the withdrawal cost.\n",

    "# Finally, the function returns the net profit or loss by subtracting the storage cost and the cost to purchase \n",
